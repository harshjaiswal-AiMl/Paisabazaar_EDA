        "This project focuses on performing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Paisabazaar Credit Score dataset to understand customer credit behavior, identify risk patterns, and uncover insights that can support better decision-making in the credit and lending ecosystem. Since credit score is one of the most critical indicators in financial services, analyzing the factors that influence it helps organizations optimize loan approvals, reduce default risk, and personalize financial offerings. The primary objective of this project was not to build a predictive machine learning model but to thoroughly analyze the dataset, identify key trends, and highlight patterns across demographic, financial, and behavioral attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset consists of various features such as age, occupation, annual income, credit utilization, number of credit cards, payment delays, credit history age, loan activity, EMI amounts, and credit inquiries. Through data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization techniques, the project examines how these attributes relate to different credit score categories—Good, Standard, and Poor. Each visualization is crafted to answer a specific analytical question and uncover actionable business insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the major findings in the analysis is that the Standard credit score category dominates across almost all segments, including age groups, occupations, and customer profiles. This indicates that while most customers maintain average credit behavior, relatively few achieve a Good credit score due to factors such as delayed payments, higher credit utilization, and lower income levels. Adults form the largest customer segment and consistently show the highest counts across all credit score categories. Teens have the lowest credit participation, and their Poor credit score count is noticeably high, suggesting early challenges in managing credit. Senior citizens show more balanced credit behavior with fewer Poor scores, likely due to reduced credit usage and better financial discipline over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Income-related insights reveal that annual income and credit score have a positive correlation. Customers with higher income tend to maintain better repayment discipline, lower credit utilization, and fewer delays, resulting in stronger credit profiles. On the other hand, a large portion of the dataset consists of low-income customers earning between ₹10,000 and ₹40,000. This segment is more prone to delayed payments and higher financial stress, which may increase the default risk if not managed properly by lenders.\n",
        "\n",
        "Behavioral factors such as number of delayed payments, credit card usage, and EMI burden strongly influence credit score outcomes. The analysis shows a clear inverse relationship between delayed payments and credit scores: as delayed payments increase, credit scores drop sharply. Similarly, customers with a high number of credit cards and high utilization ratios tend to fall into the Poor credit category. These variables highlight the importance of disciplined credit usage and timely repayments.\n",
        "\n",
        "The visual analysis also uncovers patterns across occupation, where most professions reflect a concentration in the Standard score category. Good credit scores remain relatively low across all job types, which emphasizes the need for better financial literacy and repayment planning across segments.\n",
        "\n",
        "From a business perspective, these insights can help financial institutions improve loan underwriting, identify high-risk customers, refine credit policies, personalize product offerings, and create targeted interventions such as credit-building programs or flexible repayment plans. Understanding demographic and behavioral factors also helps enhance customer segmentation and risk-adjusted lending strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this project provides a comprehensive, data-driven understanding of the credit landscape within the Paisabazaar dataset. It establishes a strong foundation for building future predictive models and offers valuable insights for lenders, credit analysts, and financial decision-makers."

Without proper analysis, it becomes difficult for lenders to identify high-risk customers, understand key credit score drivers, and design effective credit strategies.\n",

Most customers fall within the Standard credit score category across age groups and occupations, showing that average credit behaviour is common.

Income, delayed payments, number of credit cards, and EMI burden strongly influence credit score patterns. Overall, the analysis helps identify which groups are low risk (high-income, good repayment habits) and which groups require closer monitoring (low-income, high delays, Teen/Adult Poor category).\n",

Instead of creating many separate charts, a pair plot gives a complete overview of relationships between variables in a single, easy-to-read visualization, making it very useful during EDA."

Adults form the strongest and most financially active segment—they hold the highest number of accounts, credit cards, and loans, and show relatively better repayment behaviour than Teens, who display higher poor-score tendencies and weaker credit discipline. Income also plays a major role: a majority of customers belong to low-income brackets, and this group shows higher delayed payments, increased loan dependency, and greater default risk. High EMI burden, high debt, and elevated credit utilization strongly correlate with lower credit scores, forming a stressed customer segment that requires urgent monitoring.\n",

Delayed payments typically fall within 10–25 days, but extreme cases (50+ days) signal potential chronic defaulters. Product penetration shows that Economy customers dominate in accounts, credit cards, and loans, making them the primary revenue source—but also the highest risk if not managed well. Trends over time show stable Poor scores, declining Standard scores, and improving Good scores, indicating a gradual shift in customer behaviour that needs strategic attention."
